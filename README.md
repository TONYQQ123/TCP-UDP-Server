## Introduction

This project consists of Python 3.10 servers implementing both TCP and UDP MultiThread Servers.

### Features

- **TCP Calculate Server**: Reads a simple math equation and solves it.
- **UDP Channel Server**:
  - **Number Channel**: Keeps counting numbers and sends them to subscribers.
  - **English Channel**: Sends letters from A to Z to subscribers.
- **Server Differences**:
  - **TCP Server**: Waits for a connection before running.
  - **UDP Server**: Keeps running and sending messages until no IP addresses need to receive them.
- **GUI Client App**: Constructed using PYQT, and the executable file is generated using PyInstaller.
